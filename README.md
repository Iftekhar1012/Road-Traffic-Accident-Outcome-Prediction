This project applies machine learning to predict patient status and injury type from a road traffic accident dataset collected in Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan (Harvard Dataverse). The dataset contains 25 features and represents an imbalanced, multiclass classification problem.

Multiple models—including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, AdaBoost, and XGBoost—are evaluated and compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to identify effective ML approaches for accident outcome prediction to support emergency response, healthcare planning, and traffic safety analysis.
